- What I did
    [x] add score display
        now exceeding VBlank Time
    [x] add github repo
    [x] fix bug of consecutive fake blocks. maybe max height is too high
    [x] Figure out how to use sprites
    [x] reduce jump height to make the platform you departed not disappear below the screen when screen scrolling
- Plan
    [ ] change background to tilemap mode
